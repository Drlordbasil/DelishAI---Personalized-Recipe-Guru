# AI-Powered Personalized Recipe Recommendation System

The AI-Powered Personalized Recipe Recommendation System is an autonomous Python program designed to provide personalized recipe recommendations to users based on their dietary preferences, restrictions, and ingredient availability. The system utilizes web scraping techniques with the help of tools like BeautifulSoup and Google Python to dynamically gather recipe data from various cooking websites. It operates entirely without local files on the user's PC and can find or download everything it needs from the web.

## Key Features

1. User Input and Preferences
   - Utilize a command-line interface or a web interface for users to enter their dietary preferences, restrictions, and available ingredients.
   - Collect information such as preferred cuisine, cooking time, calorie count, allergies, and ingredient availability.
   - Employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and process user input accurately.

2. Web Scraping and Data Collection
   - Use the requests library to perform search queries and retrieve URLs of recipe websites based on user preferences.
   - Utilize BeautifulSoup to scrape data from recipe websites, extracting relevant information such as recipe names, ingredients, preparation steps, and cooking time.
   - Implement Google Python search queries to dynamically find and scrape additional recipe websites as needed, without hardcoding any URLs.

3. Recipe Recommendation Algorithm
   - Implement a machine learning algorithm to analyze the collected recipe data and generate personalized recommendations for the user.
   - Utilize HuggingFace small models for natural language understanding and sentiment analysis to assess the quality and relevance of recipes.
   - Consider user preferences, ingredient availability, and dietary restrictions to filter and rank the recommended recipes.

4. Recipe Generation and Presentation
   - Automatically generate recipe cards or printable recipe documents for each recommendation, including necessary ingredients, preparation steps, and cooking time.
   - Enhance the recipe cards with visually appealing graphics and additional information such as nutritional facts and serving suggestions.
   - Present the recommendations to the user through a user-friendly interface, providing options to explore further details or generate new recommendations.

5. Continuous Learning and Improvement
   - Utilize user feedback and interactions with the system to continuously improve the recommendation algorithm.
   - Implement automated data collection techniques to gather information on new recipes, trending ingredients, and popular cooking techniques.
   - Apply machine learning techniques to adapt the recommendation system based on user behavior, preferences, and changing culinary trends.

**Note: It is important to ensure that appropriate usage rights and permissions are respected while scraping data from recipe websites. Additionally, the system should comply with all legal and ethical guidelines related to data privacy and protection.**
